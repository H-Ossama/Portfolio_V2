## Who is Oussama HATTAN?

Hello! I'm **Oussama HATTAN**, a passionate Full-Stack Web Developer from M'RIRT, Morocco, specializing in building responsive and scalable web applications. With expertise in modern web technologies like React, Node.js, and various back-end systems, I transform ideas into functional, user-friendly digital experiences.

My journey in web development began at EFET, where I spent two years training as a Computer Network System Specialist Technician. After completing my diploma, I paused my formal education to join the ALX Software Engineering bootcamp, an intensive 12-month program that gave me hands-on experience in software engineering and problem-solving. Once I earned my ALX certification, I continued my studies at MULTIHEXA in Meknes, (with a focus on Database Architecture and Network Security). This diverse educational path, combined with practical experience, has equipped me to tackle complex development challenges with confidence.

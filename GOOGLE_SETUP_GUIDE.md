# Google Search Console and Analytics Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up and connect your portfolio website to Google Search Console and Google Analytics for better SEO monitoring and traffic analytics.

3. **Verify Ownership**
   - Select "HTML tag" verification method
   - Copy the meta tag verification code provided (looks like: `<meta name="google-site-verification" content="VERIFICATION_ID_HERE" />`)
   - Replace the `GOOGLE_VERIFICATION_ID` in the `SearchConsoleVerification.tsx` component with your verification code
   - Deploy your site with the updated verification code
